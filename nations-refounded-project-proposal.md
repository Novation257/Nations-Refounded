# Nations Refounded - A Persistent-World Real-Time Strategy Game 
### Team: TEAM_NAME
### Members: Jules Prater, Nic Dawson

## Intro

## Customer Value
Customer Need 
- Primary Customer - casual gamers on PC platforms
- Customer demand - These gamers are looking for a simple, entertaining game that they can play on limited hardware, such as low to mid level laptops
- Reason for demand - People get bored! These people need an enjoyable task to pass the time
- Market Context - Our game will combine and expand on proven concepts from several other games in the market

Proposed Solution
- From the customer’s POV, what will your solution deliver? - Nations Refounded will be a unique, easily accessible, group-oriented game that emphasizes daily engagement and out-of-game social interactions.
- How will the customer benefit from your proposed solution - While many casual games offer an easy pastime, they either lack enough content to be engaging over time (e.g. simple browser games that can be completed in a matter of hours) or do little to ensure a dynamic gameplay experience (e.g. Animal Crossing, where the game can feel like completing a list of chores at times). Our game will solve both of these issues by combining proven concepts from several different games, and we're aiming to create a game that offers more entertainment over a longer period of time.
- Does it provide a new capability or is it much better, easier, faster …? - We are drawing on several inspirations such as Animal Crossing, Helldivers, Clash of Clans, Sid Meier’s Civilization, and the original Nations to create a unique experience.
- Have you tested the idea on anyone? - While we have not pitched this idea to any customers, many of the games we are drawing inspiration from have been positively received; we are hoping to recreate this success while still offering an original experience.

Measures of Success
- Logins per day
- Total players
- Player retention rate after one month/year
- If customers are choosing to play and return to our game rather than others, we can assume we have given them a unique and engaging experience.
